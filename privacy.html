          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            When you submit our contact form, we collect the fields you provide: name, phone number, project type, and project details.
            We also send the current page URL (source_page) and an anti-spam field (company) with the request.
            If you contact us directly by phone or email, we process the information you choose to share.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use the service-area checker, the address you enter and selected map coordinates are processed to determine whether your location is inside our service zone.

        <article class="privacy-card">
          <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            Your information may be used to respond to inquiries and requests, provide project estimates and consultations, schedule project communication, and maintain internal service records.
            We also use technical safeguards such as anti-spam checks and short submit rate limits to protect our forms from abuse.
            We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties.
          </p>

        <article class="privacy-card">
          <h2>Analytics and Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            We use analytics only after you accept the cookie notice.
            Consent status is stored in browser local storage (tilewizards_cookie_notice_accepted).
            After consent, if analytics is configured, Google Analytics may set cookies and process usage data such as page views and interaction events (for example CTA clicks, phone clicks, and form events).
          </p>
          <p>
            We also store a short-lived local value (tilewizards_last_lead_submit_at) to reduce repeated form spam.
            You can clear cookies and local storage from your browser settings.

        <article class="privacy-card">
          <h2>Data Protection</h2>
          <p>
            We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure.
            However, no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

        <article class="privacy-card">
          <h2>Canadian Privacy Compliance</h2>
          <p>
            We handle personal information in accordance with applicable Canadian privacy laws, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and substantially similar provincial private-sector privacy laws where applicable.
          </p>
          <p>
            We collect, use, and disclose personal information for identified purposes and with appropriate consent, except where otherwise permitted or required by law.

        <article class="privacy-card">
          <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            We use third-party services to operate website features:
            Google Apps Script Web App for form delivery, Google Analytics (if enabled), and Mapbox for interactive address lookup and map rendering.
            We may also show an OpenStreetMap fallback embed and external map links.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you use these features, relevant data (for example, form fields or address search queries) may be processed by those providers under their own privacy terms.
            We recommend reviewing their privacy policies separately.

        <article class="privacy-card">
          <h2>Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We retain personal information only for as long as needed to respond to inquiries, provide services, resolve disputes, and meet legal or operational requirements.
            Retention periods may vary based on the type of request and applicable obligations.

        <article class="privacy-card">
          <h2>Your Rights</h2>
          <p>
            If you are in Canada, you may request access to personal information we hold about you and request corrections where needed, subject to legal exceptions.
            You may also withdraw consent to certain processing, subject to legal or contractual limits and reasonable notice.

          <h2>Cross-Border Processing</h2>
          <p>
            Some service providers we use may process data outside your province or outside Canada.
            When this happens, personal information may be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions.
