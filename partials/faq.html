          How much does tile installation cost in Toronto?
          <span class="faq__icon"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq__answer">
          <p>
            Tile installation costs in Toronto typically start from $10 per square foot.
            The final price depends on the type of tile, layout complexity, surface preparation,
            and project size. We always provide a clear, detailed quote before starting the work.

          How long does a typical tile installation take?

            Project timelines vary, but a standard shower tile installation usually takes about 3 days.
            Larger or more complex projects may take longer. We always discuss timelines in advance so
            you know exactly what to expect.
